# SpaceTrader 2142
## Elevator Pitch
SpaceTrader 2142 is a turn-based strategy game where corporations compete to
build vast empires of trade routes, industry and more - in space (you know,
like, outer space)! The game will feature an emphasis on trade and economics and
will slightly de-emphasize "combat" and battles.

## Inspirations
""SpaceTrader"" has many inspirations, and some of them are listed here:
* [Railroads! and the Railroad Tycoon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_(series)) 
* [The Civilization series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)) 
* [The Galactic Civilizations series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Civilizations) 
* [Barron Realms Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barren_Realms_Elite) 
* [Trade Wars 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TradeWars_2002) 

And more!

the different aspects of the game universe, and etc.
