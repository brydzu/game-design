## Theme
Space, trading, exploration, empire building, economic management

## Back Story
In the future, governments have all but collapsed and have been replaced by
corporations of all shapes and sizes. The advent of faster-than-light (FTL)
travel enabled humanity to reach out into the surrounding galaxies and star
systems of the universe. Corporations seek to establish trade routes and produce
goods and services, competing with one another for dominance over ever larger
swaths of the universe.

## Genre of the game
Turn-based 4X, with "real-time" a distant future possibility

## Platform of the game=====
Possibly [[http://jmonkeyengine.org/ jMonkeyEngine]]

##Type of game
* Multi-player 
* "pseudo 3D" 
* square or hex-based maps
  * How are galaxies and systems handled separately? a galaxy can contain
    several systems
* systems have "slots" for improvements?

## Goal of the game
Variable goals. Much like several of the other inspiration games:

* Connecting portions of the universe
* Putting other players out of business
* Achieving certain economic coals
* Etc.

## Game play mechanics
1) Just before a player's turn begins:
  1) income and expenses are calculated and tallied against the current balance
  1) any "battles" take place
  1) influence is calculated and territory may change hands
1) The player can move assets (ships, trading platforms, whatever) around on the board up to the maximum number of movement points
1) The player can initiate construction of items
1) The player can purchase things
1) The player can trade with other player or enter into agreements

## Resources
Various resources are available in the galaxies that players will uncover.
Pre-existing Civilizations in these galaxies may desire certain resources and be
willing to pay a premium.

### Resource Categories
* Precious Metals
* Base Elements
* Produce
* Animals
* Energy
* Water

Raw resources can be converted or combined into higher-order goods and services
that can themselves be resold.

## Major buildings, ships and objects

### Ships
There are essentially three ship "types":
* Trade/Transport
* Combat
* Constructor

This does not mean that a Trade/Transport ship may not have combat capabilities,
but it will be nowhere near as fast as a combat ship. Similarly, a combat ship
may be able to transport goods, but will have nowhere near the same capacity.

The constructor ship is used to build items in newly discovered areas (for
example, an outpost, or establish a settlement in a system).

### Outposts / Stations
Outposts and Stations serve several functions

* Can be parts of a trade route for warehousing
* Exert influence in an area
* ??

Can they move?

### Planetary Improvements
The construction and purchase of planetary improvements enables the player to:

* Gain access to and construct additional or different ships
* Convert/combine raw resources
* Gain access to and construct outputs / stations
* Enhance influence in an area
* ??
	
### Warp Routes
Warp routes can be constructed in order to enhance the speed of travel of ships.

Can players who have an agreement share/use other player warp routes?

## Music and sounds of the game

## Anything special about the game

## Notes and References
* Turn-based
* "Pseudo 3D": The map is flat but objects "on" the map may be drawn in 3D
* Multiplayer and versus AI (similar to Civilization)
* Not really "tech trees" but certain things may be required to be purchased/built before later things can
