## Theme
Space, trading, exploration, empire building, economic management

## Genre of the game
Turn-based 4X, with "real-time" a distant future possibility

## Platform of the game
Possibly [http://jmonkeyengine.org/](jMonkeyEngine)

Something that can actually be used cross-platform (PC, console, mobile) would
be really good, if possible.

## Type of Game
### Overview
* Multi-player, "pseudo 3D", turn-based 
  options for cooperative / competitive?
* "pseudo 3D" 
  would be cooler if we could figure out a true 3D
* square or hex-based maps
  in true 3d it would be cool to have "cubes" or some other geometric shape
* economic simulation

## Goal of the game
Variable goals. Much like several of the other inspiration games:

* Connecting portions of the universe
* Putting other players out of business
* Achieving certain economic coals
* Etc.

## Game play mechanics
* Star systems have "slots" for improvements

The mechanics need to be revisited given the interesting thoughts uncovered on
resources and "economies".

It would be super interesting to have no "money", but rather to have statistics
of wealth, influence and tech, and spheres of reach, that determined both what
you could build and how far away you could get.

1. Just before a player's turn begins:
  1. "income" and "expenses" are calculated and tallied against the current
     balances
  1. influence is calculated and territory may change hands
1. The player can move assets (ships, trading platforms, whatever) around on the board up to the maximum number of movement points
1. The player can initiate construction of items
1. The player can purchase things
1. The player can trade with other player or enter into agreements

## Resources
### Overview
Various resources are available in the galaxies that players will uncover.
Pre-existing Civilizations in these galaxies may desire certain resources and be
willing to pay a premium.

### Resource Categories
* Precious Metals
* Base Elements
* Produce
* Animals
* Energy
* Water

Raw resources can be converted or combined into higher-order goods and services
that can themselves be resold.

## Major buildings, ships and objects

### Ships
Since we want to entirely do away with combat, this section needs to be
revisited.

There are essentially three ship "types":
* Trade/Transport
* Combat
* Constructor

This does not mean that a Trade/Transport ship may not have combat capabilities,
but it will be nowhere near as fast as a combat ship. Similarly, a combat ship
may be able to transport goods, but will have nowhere near the same capacity.

The constructor ship is used to build items in newly discovered areas (for
example, an outpost, or establish a settlement in a system).

### Outposts / Stations
Outposts and Stations serve several functions

* Can be parts of a trade route for warehousing
* Exert influence in an area
* ??

Can they move?

### System Improvements
The construction and purchase of system improvements enables the player to:

* Gain access to and construct additional or different ships
* Convert/combine raw resources
* Gain access to and construct outputs / stations
* Enhance influence in an area
* ??
	
### Warp Routes
Warp routes can be constructed in order to enhance the speed of travel of ships.

Can players who have an agreement share/use other player warp routes?

### Interesting Mechanics / Thoughts
There are a few interesting posts that are worth exploring as it relates to game
play mechanics and resources:

Economies)

* Originally had written:
  Not really "tech trees" but certain things may be required to be
  purchased/built before later things can

  This should probably be revisited as it relates to "tech economies"
